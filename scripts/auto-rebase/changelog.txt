  - ed34024 2023-03-16T14:44:26+01:00 Rework gressPolicy ACLs build: previously all gress policies with at least one selector had peerAddressSet, and empty gress (allow all) was identified by "gp.sizeOfAddressSet() > 0". Now we don't create address sets like that, therefore a new hasPeerSelector field was added to distinguish empty gress from the one that just doesn't have any address sets added yet.
  - 120140f 2023-03-16T14:44:22+01:00 Add PodSelectorAddressSet object, that should be used to manage address sets for pod selector (network policy object is only responsible for local pods and peer namespace-only handlers). The locking mechanism is copied from networkPolicy.
