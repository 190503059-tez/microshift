# MicroShift RPM Packages for Development and Testing

> Connect to the Red Hat Virtual Private Network (VPN) for accessing the development packages.

MicroShift RPM development packages are intended to be used internally at Red Hat to facilitate the development and QE processes, **never** to be distributed to customers. 

The packages are built every night. Review the [MicroShift Brew Package](https://brewweb.engineering.redhat.com/brew/packageinfo?packageID=82827) page for more information about the product builds and tags. 

The packages can be downloaded from the [MicroShift Brew Download](http://download.eng.bos.redhat.com/brewroot/vol/rhel-8/packages/microshift) page. The builds are rotated every week.
